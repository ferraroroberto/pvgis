"""Example e2e smoke test — proof the headless harness works.

This is the *one* test a fresh scaffold ships with. Expand per the
regression-suite rules in CLAUDE.md ("End-to-end UI testing"): add a test
only when silent breakage would hurt, a unit test can't catch it, and the
behaviour has stabilised. Don't grow this file into a full UI net.
